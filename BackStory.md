# The Reason I need to use the Enphase API.

I had an Enphase solar system with panels and batteries installed in 2021. 
Enphase is supposed to monitor the system and deal with any issues that come up, 
and they completely failed at this a few months ago. And if I had not experienced a
power outage, I would not have noticed their failure, and things could have been much worse.

The way the battery system works (at least for my system) is that, unlike the UPS I use with my PC,
the system does not automatically switch to battery power when the grid goes down. Another quirk
is that the system will not switch back to the grid until the grid is stable for 5 minutes.
The switch back to the grid is seamless, so I would not know that it had switched back without 
checking the Enlighten app.

This outage caused me to lose power for a second or two, at which point I checked with
the neighbors to see if they also lost power. They had not, and they also did
not experience the fluctuation in power that I did, which was strange.

After 5 minutes or so I checked the Enlighten app to see if the system had switched back to the 
grid. But I wasn't able to see this information because the system had stopped reporting data 
to the app 6 weeks (!) prior. 

I spent the next few hours on the phone with Enphase support, while reporting a power outage 
to the utility company. Enphase told me that there was a note in my account that 
the system was not reporting data (they never contacted me about this). The note said
that an RMA request was placed for the Envoy, but nothing happened with that either. The note
was dated 4 weeks after the system stopped reporting data, and no explanation was given 
for that delay. Enphase support said that they were placing a new RMA request, and that I
should contact my installer to get the Envoy replaced after it arrived.

After that phone call, I was notified by the utility company that they had restored my power.
Since I was unable to see the system status in the app, I went outside to check the LEDs in the
battery system. They were still discharging, so I reported the outage to the utility company again.

This caused an actual human to call me back, and they said that their system was showing that
the grid was up, and had never gone down for me during the time in question.

So I called Enphase again, and they walked me through manually attempting to reconnect to the grid.
This failed, indicating that the system was not happy with the grid connection. So I told them that 
I would report an outage again. I also told Enphase that the LEDs were blue, which meant that 
the batteries did not have much power left. They did not seem concerned about this.

Before I could re-report the outage, I got a message from the utility company rep
that he had decided to send a crew out to check the grid connection. Which was fortunate,
because they found an issue with a connection and were able to fix it.

Before they left, I had another loss of power for a second or two, and I went back out
to tell them. Before we could check the meter, I checked the manual grid connection that
Enphase had told me to use, and found that it was in fact connected to the grid.

This re-connection must have been the cause of this second outage, even though that doesn't 
typically happen. Perhaps this was due to the manual override attempt.

I called Enphase again the next day because one of the LEDs on the batteries was now out completely.
It had been discussed earlier that the Envoy failure was also causing the batteries to not charge 
properly, so I thought that they might want to know about this. I remember during the initial 
commissioning of the system that the installer had said that the batteries should never be allowed 
to discharge below a certain point as it could cause damage to them. So I thought that perhaps 
Enphase would want to hasten the Envoy replacement. Once again, I was met with indifference.

A day later all the LEDs were out. A few days after that I got an email from FedEx with an 
arrival date for the Envoy replacement, allowing me to schedule an appointment with the installer.

The installer came out a few days later and replaced the Envoy. To no one's surprise (at least 
not mine), the batteries did not come back online. The installer had to come back the next day, 
call Enphase support again, and was lucky enough to connect with a knowledgeable support person 
who was able to get the batteries back online.

However, 2 of the 6 batteries are stiil not fully functional. One is unable to update its firmware, 
and the other always shows 99 percent charge and keeps trying to charge to reach 100 percent. I have
had a case open for 6 weeks now, and all they do is push the rock back up the hill and hope it stays 
there, promising that if it rolls back down again, they will try something else. I am still waiting 
on that something else part.

One thing that really had me upset turned out to be untrue. My installer thought that the Envoy 
failure would also cause the solar panel energy production to fail, but it did not. (It was 
just never reported to Enphase, as can be seen in the pictures elsewhere.) The panels continued 
to produce power that was either used or sent out to the grid, which I was able to verify 
by checking the utility bill.

The final result of all this is the old adage that if you want something done right, you have to 
do it yourself. So I will be creating my own monitoring system to watch over my Enphase system, 
and this project is the first step toward that goal.
