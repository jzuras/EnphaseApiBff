### Concurrency Issues and Pre-rendering with Refreshing Tokens

After adding Claude's code for refreshing the token, I quickly tested it by forcing a token refresh.
However, when I came back a few days later, the refresh code had an error, something about headers
being read-only. This seems to be caused by a timing or concurrency issue related
to the pre-rendering.

As is typically the case with these projects of mine, this one is more complicated
than it needs to be, which is by design for learning purposes. In this case I made it
overly complicated by using InteractiveAuto as the rendering mode. I think the reason the
refresh code originally worked was that the interactive rendering was being done 
on the client using WASM. When I try this in an incognito window, the pre-rendering
is done on the server, and the token refresh code fails with the error about headers.

And as is typical with AI code, the AI that wrote it is not always helpful in debugging it,
so I turned to ChatGPT. Another problem I had is with terminology: 
pre-rendering can be static or interactive, and the HttpContext is not available 
in the static pre-rendering. This confused both AIs (and me) for a while.

Eventually I was able to pinpoint the issue to the SignInAsync call during the second 
refresh attempt.

(I should note here that even with WASM, the token refresh is running on the server,
so I am not yet clear on why the issue only occurs when the interactive
rendering is done on the server vs WASM. I suspect it has to do with 
WASM using the RemoteAuthenticationStateProvider.)

The code fix was to determine if the Sign In was going to fail, by checking if
the Response HasStarted. If it has, then the SignInAsync call should not be made.
Instead, the code saves the access token and returns false, and the calling code
then uses the saved token instead of getting it from the AuthenticationStateProvider.
(The signing-in is done only to store the new tokens anyway at this point, because
the user is already signed in when this part of the code runs.)

I also want to note that I have the fix for this issue in the code, but it is not
necessary because I have turned off pre-rendering (which I did because the Enphase 
APIs have limits for total calls and calls per minute, so I don't want to call them twice).
